Hooks Readme

- Pass in the '--show-hooks' flag to see all hooks that are running for a command

- to add code for a hook, simply make a file named that hook inside of a new 'vv' folder inside of the root of 'vvv'
this file can be any command line runnable language, and will be executed inline
	for example:

		#! /usr/bin/php
		echo 'Hello'

Running npm install inside of wp-content for all new sites:
	Make a file named post_site_creation_finished - this file gets 3 variables passed in, the site name, the site domain, and the path to the site

		#!/bin/bash
		cd "$3"
		npm install
